# Royale

Royale is a simple-to-use Clash Royale statistics website that was based on the late RoyaleAPI service.

## Notice
The [RoyaleAPI](https://royaleapi.com) service has been shut down in Late 2019, and therefore, this website will no longer function.
Eventually, this project will be rewritten in React, and will utilize the official [Clash Royale API](https://developers.clashroyale.com).
